                Probably one of the most fun, interesting, and challenging skills that I
                have developed in the first semester of my program is learning 
                the <em>two</em> most <strong>important</strong>
                components of website design, <strong>HTML and CSS</strong>.
                In my opinion, I believe that these two serve as the bread and butter 
                for any front end developer. With these two, I learned how 
                to make the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>CSS grids</li>
                <li>CSS Flexboxes</li>
                <li>CSS Animations</li>
                <li>spreadsheets/tables in HTML</li>
                <li>pseudo classes like <strong>::hover, ::after, ::before, and ::first-of-type</strong></li>
                <li>And more</li>
            </ul>

                Using the Problem Solving Skills in Programming Fundamentals 
            </h5>
            <p>
                Although I had <em>some</em> knowledge when it came to programming
                in the language of Python, before coming into the semester,
                I have <strong>never</strong> considered implementing
                specific problem solving strategies when programming or
                solving a problem using code. In general,
                I would attempt to solve my problem in a 
                <strong>Brute force</strong> type of approach. However, later on
                the way in my programming journey,
                I realized that this method is not always 
                going to work in favour of mine and there are better
                more efficient/effective ways to go about 
                approaching a problem of code. And that is when I considered 
                looking into the different problem solving strategies.
                Some of the strategies that I have learned were
                <strong>Decompostion</strong>, which is breaking down 
                components of a problem into smaller steps, 
                <strong>Abstraction</strong>, making an "Abstract" view 
                of the problem to better understand it, and 
                <strong>Analogy</strong>, which is applying something
                that I am familiar with from before,
                in order to solve the problem.
